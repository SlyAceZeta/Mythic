# Mythic (Fork)
This is a fork of [Mythic](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Mythic), a theme inspired by the Epic Games Launcher for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) Desktop Mode.

The differences are specific to the Details view:
* Increased margin between the left (description) and right (play button) sections
* Decreased the spacing between the items in the left section
* Moved the [Extra Metadata Loader](https://playnite.link/addons.html#ExtraMetadataLoader_705fdbca-e1fc-4004-b839-1d040b8b4429) logo above the left section and raised the right section
  * This requires Playnite's Settings -> Appearance -> Details View -> "Vertical spacing to game details" to be set to a higher number, i.e. 350
* Removed the tabs for Related games, etc.
* Changed the [SuccessStory](https://github.com/Lacro59/playnite-successstory-plugin) progress bar color to yellow
